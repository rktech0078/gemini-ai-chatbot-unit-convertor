# 🤖 Gemini AI Chatbot

### **🚀 Overview**
This project was assigned as part of **Quarter 3 (Q3) of the "Governor Initiative for Artificial Intelligence, Web 3.0, and Metaverse (GIAIC)"** by **Sir Zia Khan and Arif Rozanai**. The original task was to build a **simple unit converter**, but since innovation was encouraged, I decided to create an **AI-powered chatbot** using Google Gemini API.
